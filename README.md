# 🐭 Mickey Mouse with HTML & CSS

Welcome to my creative coding project! This is a pure **HTML + CSS** rendering of **Mickey Mouse**, designed from scratch without using any images, JavaScript, or external libraries. The entire character has been constructed using **CSS shapes, borders, gradients, shadows**, and a whole lot of patience.
